# Peopleware


* People sloppily use the word politics to mean anything people related, sociological problems are more tractable than political ones
* We are in the business of human communication. The technical work is often trivial in comparison.
* We aren't making cheeseburgers, don't manage people with a production line style.
* Fostering an atmosphere that does not tolerate error makes people defensive, when people "blow it" they've saved us a dead end
* Catalysts are important. Someone who helps the team gel is worth two people who actually do the work.
* The steady state cheeseburger mentality
* Some managers out there seem to go against the work smarter mentality and believe management is getting as much work out of your employees
* Productivity is about increasing output per hour of work not per unit of pay
* Workaholism is like a common cold, we all get bouts of it from time to time. If you exploit this trait as a manager you'll lose them in the long term.
* Some productivity measures will make work less enjoyable or less interesting and will come at the cost of some staff. Is it worth it? Productivity is benefit divided by cost and that cost includes replacing people.
* "Spanish Theory" mangers impose tight restrictions to work people harder under pressure. Often the deadlines are arbitrary.
* Pressure makes people work faster, not better.
* Discouraging quality will damage a teams self esteem and turn them against you. Managers may think short deadlines are a challenge but experienced workers know better
* As makers, self esteem is often tied to the quality of the product. Building a bad product will make them hate it. The minimum quality will be what they have achieved in the past (often more than required)
* Quality is not a parameter of the project that you can apply more or less of. Quality beyond what the user wants is a way of obtaining higher productivity. Quality most often matters more to the builder than the user.
* Think Japan - it is possible to obtain high productivity and high quality. Some Japanese companies give the development team power of veto to not ship a product they believe is not ready, even if the user will take it
* A policy of "quality if time permits" will ensure 0 quality will make it to the product


### 5
* Parkinson's law alleges work expands to fill the time allotted, but peopleware argues that only applies if there is no job derived satisfaction.
* People who don't perform suffer lack of competence, confidence or lack of affiliation with the team or goals. More pressure won't solve this.
* Well knit teams will often self regulate?
* Treating people as Parkinsonian workers will demean and demoralise
* Unrealistic or unreasonable estimates sap energy and lowers morale
* A manager's job is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work


### 7


* We employ intellect workers, they are disrupted easily by distraction and noise
* Furniture Police
* Best staff outperform worst 10:1, outperform median 2.5:1, better than median outperform less than median 2:1 and this is seen at an org level too.
* Better orgs seem to provide better work space and less interruptions
* Environmental trend is toward less privacy, less dedicated space and more noise. Penny saved on workspace is a penny saved on the bottom line…
* Noise equals defects
* If people hide to work that's an indictment of the workplace. Saving money on space is costing you money.
* You can't afford not to know how your productivity compares to another org. Measuring something is better than nothing (Gilb's Law)
* Measuring should be for improvement, motivation and satisfaction but often ends up used for threatening
* Measurements should not be routed via management, individual numbers are for self assessment - managers don't need this data to benefit from it
* Frequent opportunities for private self assessment are a must


### 10


* Flow time is critical
* Payroll time sheets count body time not brain time
* Payroll info useless for productivity assessment
* E factor = flow hours / present hours
* Does this message need immediate recognition? If not, send or reply accordingly
* Silence can be key - music whether through headphones or Muzak can interfere with creative problem solving
* Management at its best should ensure enough space, quiet and privacy for groups to make their own workspace. Grin and bear it when they settle, clutter and move things around. When they are comfortable they'll just get on with the work.


### 13


* Christopher Alexander's Concept of Organic Order (the timeless way of building, 1979)
* Workplace should have an intimacy gradient of privacy
* Communal eating space can hold a group together
* Solve the space problem for your group
* If you can get out of corporate space you'll probably work better, less interruption and form a group identity


### 14


* Management science tends to treat the role of manager as someone playing a strategy game. You make good decisions and deploy your faceless resources well and win. Success however comes from getting the right people, keeping them happy and turning them loose. Success or failure is often decided when you assemble the team and the initial direction.
* Getting the right people in the first place is key. People often don’t stick around long enough, or be influenced enough by a manager to change.
* Popcorn is not professional. In a health org, professional means knowledgeable and competent.


### 15
* Leadership by work extraction is not the right ethos for thinking teams, it serves to enhance the quantity not quality of work.
* Leadership is a service. You must be demonstrably up to the task, maximise value and work with humour and goodwill.
* Use the academic approach of having interviewees giving a talk and let current staff help make the decision. This allows one to really see what their communication skills are like and gives the current team buy-in on selecting the next team member. Make sure the speaker talks about something close to your line of work, else that passion from their interview might well be missing when they join the team.
* Team jell takes time and is disrupted by each new addition. You must give teams time to settle. High turnover positions such as contractors may obstruct jell.


### 18 


* Continuous partial attention seems to be the norm for younger people but gets in the way of flow, and obstructed flow gets in the way of team jell.
* Articulate the contract to workers, what time do you expect them to work, how do you expect them to use that time?
* CPA is not just a problem with young people, this applies to phone and email checking during meetings too.
* Articulate the contract on how information should be communicated. Young people are less likely to see the value of checking their email.


### 19 
* Cost of turnover is around 3-5 months of employee cost (a large % of the cost to keep them for two years)
* Healthy companies have low and flat hierarchies. Tall narrow hierarchies are a sign of using promotion to keep people around -- everyone is a manager.
* Good companies talk about how good they are, it is a common goal -- providing common direction, joint satisfaction and a team binding effect. Also offers a feeling of permanence.
* Being the best is a long term concept.
* People stay because there is a widespread feeling that you are expected to stay. Training is investment and adds to this.


### 20
* Expenses are used up, investment on assets is effectively converting money from one form into another and does not appear on your Profit and Loss.
* Managers think about training as an expense, but it is an investment. That person has learned something they have for their job.
* Companies of knowledge workers must remember to treat the lead-in time and training as investment. Letting that person go in hard times, wastes that investment.


### 21


* Our treasured moments of success usually focus around challenge. But really, the challenge is the backdrop to good team interactions. The challenge is the instrument for a team coming together.
* Team is often used to mean a group of people working together. But a true team needs jell. Jell drives enjoyment and success. A well jelled team can extract pride and enjoyment from even quite dry projects.
* Believe that workers will buy in to corporate goals automatically is naive optimism
* Teams are important for goal alignment, not goal attainment -- it is individuals who ultimately score the goals, but a focussed team allows for more effective members
* Jelled teams are marked by a strong sense of identity, jelled teams are more likely to stick together. Jelled members are less worried by money or status and it will take a lot more for them to be tempted to leave.
* IBM Black Team
* You can’t make a team jell. You can only hope it will happen.
* You don’t build teams, you grow them. Like software, team building is gardening.


### 23 Teamicide


* Defensive management, bureaucracy, physical separation, fragmented time, quality reduction, phony deadlines and clique control are sure fire ways to ruin jell
* You must trust your own people, even if they are not that good. If they know you don’t trust their work and give space to make mistakes, that will inhibit jell. The right to be wrong makes you free in a team.
* Paper pushing demoralises teams
* No-one can be part of multiple jelled teams
* Co-workers making a shoddy product don't want to look each other in the eye, nor sign their name to the work
* The “team phenomenon” only happens at the bottom of the hierarchy, jell doesn't seem to happen at a management level
* Overtime that is not applied uniformly and members cover for others can ruin jell - eventually they feel like they are carrying that missing member
* Overtime also encourages compensatory undertime - where staff take longer breaks, or don’t rush back from lunch, or take days and weeks off
* Jelled teams will conduct team-coaching, this often doesn’t even seem like coaching to those involved - just work
* In an overly competitive environment, nobody wants to show a weakness and nobody will seek coaching as it signals that you know less about something that someone else
* Performance and merit pay, or singling subsets of members out for excellent work will create competition -- any action that rewards team members differently will create competition 
* Ensemble may be a better word than team, and choirs are a better example of well jelled groups than sports teams. Success of the individual and the team should not be divorced.
* Good managers provide frequent easy opportunities for teams to succeed together. The best success is when there doesn’t appear to be any evident management -- the team may not even feel “managed”.
* A person you can't trust with autonomy is useless to you. Give your best shot putting someone in a role and once you have made the decision, don’t second guess.
* Skunkworks is just successful insubordination
* Some companies post projects and get teams internally to apply 


### 28
* Make a cult of quality
* Teams need closure - a feeling they are on track and doing a good job
* Hard to manage employees may be reacting negatively to too much control
* “The great manager knows people cannot be controlled in any meaningful sense anyway”
* Teams are really networks rather than hierarchies
* Avoid teams of Uniform Plastic People
* People want to accept responsibility, but only if they have the freedom to control things


### 29
* Convergence of methods is a good thing, but big M Methodologies are not the only way to achieve this. Big M tries to enforce convergence. Alternatives include training, automated aids and tools, and peer review
* You can’t call something a standard unless it is basically a de facto standard already
   * “A proven method for undertaking a repeated task”
* Hawthorne Effect: people seem to enjoy being involved in something new


### 30 Risk


* Two failure modes for risk: risk-tasking without risk management and complete risk-aversion 
* It is not defeatism to consider risk of your own failure, risk management enables sensible mitigation
* Don’t ignore risk for events “that just can’t happen” 
* Sometimes “this is so important it must be done by X” actually means “this is so unimportant we don't want to fund it beyond X” -- false challenge
* If something is risky and there really isn’t time to circumvent this, then somebody must be aware they are shouldering that risk -- “we can take this on, with the scary deadline but we can’t manage the risk that we won’t make it despite best efforts, but someone will. We can’t see this as a challenge without evidence of a risk management plan”


### 31 meetings


* Meetings offer visibility and can turn into competitive windbagging
* Technology often fails to enhance meetings
* A meeting where a decision must be made is a working meeting and should only include the people needed to come to that decision, off-agenda items should not be discussed
* Working meetings are ended by a decision, not the time. Meetings ended by the clock are ceremonies -- often this just involves a series of 1:1s with everyone present
* Many people attend meetings out of defensive participation, to make sure they don’t miss anything
* Open space meetings - basically people in a room bumping into eachother
* The ultimate management sin is wasting people’s time 
* Regular meetings are circumspect as ceremonies, working meetings are for decisions which are ad-hoc. Status meetings are more about confirmation than information
* Many projects are early overstaffed, often for not wanting to take the risk of failing with a lean team


### 33 email


* “Yes your inbox is full, very impressive”
* “Do I need to know this?” - “Does X need to know this?”
* “Life is short, if you need to know everything in order to do anything, you’re not going to get much work done”
* Allow people to pull information from you, don’t push it to them
* Don’t allow silence to be used as consent -- get explicit approval for things


### 34


* The fundamental response to change is not logical, but emotional
* Blindly loyal (will probably just jump on the next bandwagon too), militantly opposed are the main enemies. The change relies on convincing the “believers but questioners”
* Who are the masters of the ways that currently work, are these people going to be offended by the change? Celebrate the old as a way to help change happen.
   * X was good but the underlying technology of Y is outdated, plus we have Z now. We need your expertise on X to redesign the entire system for the better.
* You can never improve if you don’t change…!
* Satir’s model of change: Old way [catalyst] Chaos [transforming idea] Practice and Integration, New way
* The chaos is where you feel like “we were better off with the old way”. You’re suffering the learning curve. You ARE worse off, for now.
   * It is frustrating and sometimes embarrassing to shed ways you know well in favour of being a novice at something new. This is why the response to change is so emotional.
   * The worse the chaos, the better the new way seems, if and when you finally get there
* Chaos is an integral part of change -- don’t confuse the chaos stage for the new way


### 35
* Experience and learning are not the same thing
* Experience turns into learning when you or an org alter itself to take account of what experience has shown -- instilling new skills/approaches, or operating a different way
* Learning is limited at an org level by the ability to retain its people
* Successful learning organisations are characterised by strong middle management -- where real decisions are made -- downsizing often attacks middle management and the “learning center”
### 36


* The science of making communities is Aristotelian Politics
* Fostering a community at the workplace is an Art
* You won’t do it alone, indeed at best, you can be the catalyst for it to occur and nothing more


### 37


* Buried in our minds is the idea that work should be onerous, if you’re enjoying it then it isn’t work
* Humans are the enemies of chaos, we like to clean it away and replace it with order
* Good managers parcel up the chaos and pass it around for others to have the fun of dealing with it
* Some disorder is good: constructive reintroduction of small amounts of disorder
   * Pilot projects (new and unproved techniques), war games, brainstorming, training, conferences, retreats
   * Pilot things one at a time -- don’t be tricked into trying out everything new at once
   * Run a war game or tournament properly, look after people and be prepared to spend more on the war game than if you had just done the project properly
   * Brainstorming
      * Analogies -- how does nature solve this problem?
      * Inversion -- how might we achieve the opposite of our goal?
   * Ship off new starters together to a conference or something to get to know eachother
* No budget? Surprise lunches, it doesn’t have to be expensive -- inject some whimsy to people’s day
* Good sense and order are required for the work day,  but there is a time and place for some adventure, silliness -- small amounts of constructive disorder


### 38 


* Retain the best people as “free electrons” - people with a free mandate to basically define their own job -- intrapreneurs 
   * Most people need to be told their charter, managing the ones who don’t is another matter
   * Mark of a good manager is identifying people with perspective and maturity and turning them loose and get out of their way


### Conclusion


Take on the Furniture Police, fight corporate entropy, defeat teamcidial tendencies, put more quality into the product (even if there isnt time), repeal Parkinson’s Law, loosen up on Methodologies, raise your E-factor, open your kimono. You may just achieve one of these things. One change is plenty.
* You don’t fight the bull
* It doesnt take much to wake the giant
